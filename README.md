# JSC-Hackathon
This is my project for the 2022 JSC Hackathon

The project won Best in Topic: Healthy Humans in Space: Mind + Body

The program contains a basic java gui that has the user play two different games, one that tests reflexes and another that tests color perception. After both games are played, the recorded user metrics are put into a .txt file as well as the date and time the game was played.

The purpose of this project is to track user data over time, if implemented into the ISS, astronauts could play the game once per day with their data being recorded and graphed. This game could give NASA insight to otherwise undetected or immesureable metrics in space.
